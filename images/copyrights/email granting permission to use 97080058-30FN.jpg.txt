Subject: permission to use image from your website 

Regarding this image
http://picturethis.pnl.gov/im2/97080058-30FN0/97080058-30FN.jpg in this
context http://picturethis.pnl.gov/PictureT.nsf/All/3RF37L?opendocument

I am developing a website in geochronology at the University of Kansas,
a non-profit project we are doing with EarthChem.org and EARTHTIME.org. 
I would like to know if it would be possible to use an image from your
website on the home page. The image would be one of several that would
appear when the home page loads. I would display a caption, any credit
you wish, and a link back to your website if you wish.

This is our geochronology website which is still in development and has
not yet been publicized:  
http://geoportal.kgs.ku.edu/earthchem/geochron_dev/index.cfm

Thank you for your consideration.
