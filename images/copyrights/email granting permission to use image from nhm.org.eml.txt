Hi Eileen,

 

How about a credit line something like "Photo by Lou Perloff, courtesy of The Photo-Atlas of Minerals" or "©Lou Perloff/The Photo-Atlas of Minerals"?

Hello,

 

I am developing a website in geochronology at the University of Kansas,

a non-profit project we are doing with EarthChem.org and EARTHTIME.org.

I would like to use an image from your Atlas on the home page. The image

would be one of several that would appear when the home page loads.

 

On this page http://www.nhm.org/pam/photo.htm it is mentioned that the

photographer, who is deceased, had given permission for nonprofit

organizations to use his images with proper credit. I found his photo,

credited to him in this context:

http://www.mineralatlas.com/mineral%20photos/R/rutile1.jpg ?

 

What sort of caption would be appropriate to add to the photo if

displayed on our website? Would it be the photographer, or your

organization as well?

 

This is our geochronology website - not yet publicized - where I would

like to use the photo: 

http://geoportal.kgs.ku.edu/earthchem/geochron_dev/index.cfm

 

Thank you for your consideration.
