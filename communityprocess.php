Geochron is a part of the <a href="http://www.earthchem.org">EarthChem</a> and <a href="http://www.iedadata.org/">Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance (IEDA)</a> projects.  A series of workshops have been run for the various methods of analysis.  These were typically small in size (3 to 10 participants) and involved data reduction experts as well as general community members.  Each attempted to establish data reporting requirements as well as how a website should function.  Reports on the methods can be found at: <a href="http://www.earthchem.org/workshops">http://www.earthchem.org/workshops</a>.
