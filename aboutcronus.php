<h1>About CRONUS</h1>

<table cellspacing=5 cellpadding=5 border=0 align="center">

<tr>
	<td>



The objective of the CRONUS-Earth Project is to simultaneously address the various uncertainties affecting the production and accumulation of in-situ cosmogenic nuclides, with the goal of producing a widely accepted and internally consistent set of parameters that can be used in calculating exposure durations and erosion rates.<br><br>
The purpose of this web page is to facilitate international communication and discussion for the CRONUS-Earth project.Ê The web site is dedicated solely to scientific research and funding directed toward improving the reliability of applying terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide results to solve Earth Sciences questions.Ê Currently, the project is focused on isotopes that are produced in-situ in exposed minerals.Ê However, results from many of the proposed CRONUS-Earth experiments will have immediate bearings on studies using cosmogenic nuclides that are produced in the atmosphere or extra-terrestrially.
