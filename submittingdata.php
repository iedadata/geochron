<h1>Submitting Data</h1>

Geochron is designed to accept data from a variety of <a href="submitdata.php">data reduction</a> programs that are used widely  in the various geochronology and thermochronology communities. These programs have features to seamlessly upload data to Geochron, but do require a unique sample or aliquot identifier.  You can access these programs under the <a href="submitdata.php">Data Reduction Software</a> part of the website.  Many of these will accommodate legacy data or data not reduced by those programs.  We are working on tabular forms for upload of legacy data for some of the methods.
